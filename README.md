Description: i have an onboarding site for companys so new people have 1 place for all the information when starting it can be a lot sometimes. with this site companies can have more information in one place.
The Onboarding Website is a tool designed to help new employees integrate into a company by providing essential information, training materials, and an interactive experience. The website acts as a help for onboarding, featuring an easy to navigate interface and a set of essential tools to ensure that new hires get up to speed quickly and effectively. It is particularly useful for remote teams or companies that want to digitize their onboarding process.

it has a log in function so information is protected. Employees have their own accounts, and all sensitive information is protected behind authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access internal onboarding materials.
there are diffrent pages filled with information which a company can change depending on their needs.
It holds information on mentors so the new employees always know who to reach out to, upcoming events a section for upcoming events where employees can sign up. This allows the company to estimate the number of attendees for onboarding sessions, training workshops, or company gatherings.
it has training videos which i would like to connect with test in the future,that employees must complete after watching a video, making learning more interactive. This way it's easy and all in one place.
It also has a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page helps new employees quickly find answers to common onboarding questions and a page to contact somebody for all you questons, this way it's easy to ask for help.

i've used javascript, CSS and HTML to keep it user friendly but also get the design i wanted
i wanted a simple but chique design that would be user friendly, so it can easily be changed depanding on the company.
i've also used python and flask for the database and authentication
